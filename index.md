% Probabilistic Models of Cognition

In this book, we explore the probabilistic approach to cognitive science, which models learning and reasoning as inference in complex probabilistic models. In particular, we examine how a broad range of empirical phenomena in cognitive science (including intuitive physics, concept learning, causal reasoning, social cognition, and language understanding) can be modeled using a functional probabilistic programming language called Church.

## How to use

Best viewed in Chrome/Safari on a laptop/desktop (smartphone/tablet not recommended).

This book contains exercises where you write and run Church code directly in the browser. To save your progress on these exercises, you can register an account. Registering also helps us improve the book by tracking what kinds of programs users run and what kinds of errors they encounter.

<!-- login/register links need to be in a div with id 'register' so that nav.js can show the appropriate content (i.e., a login/register section if the user is not logged in and a logout section if the user is logged in)   -->
